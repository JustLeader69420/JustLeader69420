### I enjoy messing around with electronics and software stuff :)

I sometimes play around with electronics using Arduinos and ESPs, or I might write/change up some code for some other projects like my 3D Printer's firmware, or simple bash/bat/whatever scripts for automation.

Check out my Gitea instance, which I use a bit more than GitHub: https://git.jldr.eu
